# go-with-tests
This is the repo I'm using to go through the [Go With Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) resource by Chris James. 

Left off [here](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world#hello-world...-again)- implemented but not read the walkthrough or the code.
